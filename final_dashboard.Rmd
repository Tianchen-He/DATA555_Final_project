### Aspirin Safety Dashboard

#### Drug-Specific Adverse Event Analysis
```{r widget1}
selected_drug <- "ASPIRIN"

top_events <- event_counts %>%
  filter(Drug == selected_drug) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = Count, n = 100)

# Create an interactive DT table
datatable(top_events, 
          options = list(
            pageLength = 10,
            autoWidth = TRUE,
            scrollY = '400px',
            dom = 'Bfrtip',
            buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')
          ),
          extensions = 'Buttons')
```

> **Key Takeaways**:
> The table displays the top 100 most frequently reported adverse events associated with Aspirin in the FAERS database. The most common side effects include conditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and dizziness, which are well-documented risks of Aspirin use. This visualization allows users to quickly identify potential safety concerns and assess the relative frequency of different adverse reactions, which is valuable for pharmacovigilance and post-market drug safety monitoring.

#### Serious Outcomes by Drug Class
```{r widget2}
# Count serious outcomes for Aspirin
serious_outcome_counts <- faers_clean %>%
  group_by(Serious_Outcome) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(!is.na(Serious_Outcome))

# Create interactive stacked bar chart
plot2 <- ggplot(serious_outcome_counts, aes(x = Serious_Outcome, y = Count, fill = Serious_Outcome)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Serious Outcomes for Aspirin",
       x = "Outcome Type",
       y = "Number of Reports",
       fill = "Outcome") +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Convert to interactive plotly chart with legend toggle & hover tooltips
ggplotly(plot2, tooltip = c("x", "y", "fill"))
```

> **Key Takeaways**:
> This chart illustrates the proportions of serious outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, life-threatening events, death) linked to Aspirin-related adverse events. A significant number of reports involve hospitalization, indicating that some adverse effects may require medical intervention. By allowing users to toggle specific outcomes, this visualization helps in understanding the severity of reported cases, aiding healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies in monitoring drug safety trends.

### Dataset Description
The data used in this dashboard come from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a publicly available pharmacovigilance database maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It contains spontaneous reports of adverse drug events submitted by healthcare professionals, manufacturers, and consumers. This project uses FAERS data from Q1 2023 through Q4 2024, extracted from the quarterly ASCII files provided by the FDA. The analysis focuses specifically on reports where “ASPIRIN” was listed as a suspect drug. Each adverse event is coded using the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology to ensure standardized classification.

### Real-World Impact
Aspirin is one of the most commonly used over-the-counter medications, yet it still carries significant risks. This dashboard provides evidence from real-world adverse event reports, helping clinicians, patients, and regulatory agencies better understand and respond to the drug’s safety profile. By making complex FAERS data more accessible and interpretable, the dashboard contributes to more informed healthcare decisions and stronger pharmacovigilance.
